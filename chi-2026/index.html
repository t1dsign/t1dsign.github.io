        Crip HCI: Cyborg Perspectives on Disability Justice
      </h1>

      <p class="workshop-tagline">
        <!-- Short description -->
        Building on an emerging awareness of disability justice and calls for a crip HCI,
        this workshop brings together disabled researchers across HCI with an interest in
        how the politics and design of cyborg technologies relate to the rich, situated,
        and existential understandings that emerge from living a cyborg life.
        By centering the perspectives of cyborgs, this workshop de-centers extractive
        techno-solutionist practices to catalyze research momentum and foster the
        crip research community in HCI.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are engaged with envisioning,
        designing and building technologies that are tied to specific ideas of the kinds of
        futures that we seek for humans living with machines. In science fiction, cyborgs —
        part human, part machine — have been a consistent presence in allowing for a critical
        and generative engagement with such future imaginaries. But, cyborgs are not only
        the stuff of far-off science fiction. In fact, many disabled people readily
        embrace the figure of the cyborg as an important aspect of their subjectivity and
        identity since they live intimately with a variety of assistive technologies [5, 9].
        These include, for example, Type 1 Diabetics that use “smart” insulin pumps and sensor
        systems, pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, bionic eyes, prosthetic
        limbs, exoskeletons, hearing aids or cochlear implants [23] and many other assistive
        devices and, even, biotechnological examples such as pharmaceuticals and hormones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like HCI’s focus on the relationship between individual users and their machines rather
        than community engagement, the healthcare system in the context of neoliberal capitalism
        also insists on individual management of health conditions. As such, convening and communing
        itself can be seen as a radical act that works against the isolation of individuals.
        This workshop invites self-identified fellow cyborgs to consider what the field of HCI
        might gain from a deeper engagement  with cyborg perspectives on disability justice in order
        to advance the sub-field of “crip HCI” as well as inform broader studies of disability,
        assistive devices, health tech, and the field at large.
      </p>

      <p>
        While HCI has long studied relationships between humans and machines that might be considered as cyborg
        — in realms such as labor and work and health and medicine - the field is starting to also engage
        with critical perspectives from disability studies. Furthermore, with some notable exceptions,
        HCI researchers often consider their users as objects of their research rather than participants with
        agency in their own right [23, 25, 30]. This is particularly true when the users are disabled people,
        whose views are often dismissed and valued less than that of able-bodied humans, even if these humans
        have no lived experience [26, 31]. Recognizing that disability studies should inform HCI [16], Spiel et al. [26]
        highlighted the field’s predominant focus on medical models of disability and criticized the
        lack of full participation of disabled people in research about them. In effect, disabled users often
        find themselves, if at all, in a form of pseudo-participation, relegated to expressing their
        lived experience as data points for the designers to analyze and use [19] without having the power to
        shape the research goals itself.
        In a 2021 article in ACM Interactions, Williams et al. [32] argued that: “A crip HCI would
        generatively integrate the plurality of cripistemologies, the unique onto-epistemologies of disabled
        people in resistance to normative narrative, in the practice of forging new sociotechnical futures —
        futures in which the presence of disabled people is not only natural and welcome but also desired. To that end,
        crip HCI recognizes the researcher as situated, and thus articulated within, the sociotechnical
        meta-contexts of society, scholarship, research, and design inquiry and practice.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Disabled people have a rich, situated, and existential understanding of the politics of cyborg
        technologies as well as a desire to shape their own lives as well as those of their communities in
        line with principles of disability justice. Through our proximity to technology, disabled people
        experience both the significant harms that assistive devices perpetuate as well as the joys of
        living with technologies that others might delegate to “the future”. Following disability studies scholar
        Alison Kafer [10], Laura Forlano [6] uses the term “disabled cyborg” as an identity as a reminder that it is not.

      <h2>Call for Participants</h2>
      <p>
        To join us in this three-hour workshop, we invite you to submit a short position statement explaining why you want to participate
        (max. 400 words). This might be a reflection, project description or (be accompanied by) a creative/artistic
        submission (e.g., zine page or photos) related to your past, present, or future lived experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can upload your submission to <a href="https://cloud.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/s/5XNaw9f9rG8WqR9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextCloud</a> (Password: cyborg-chi2026).
        </p>
        <p>
        Submissions will be evaluated for quality, diversity, and relevance to disabled cyborg experiences.
        If accepted, you will be asked to briefly share your submission during the workshop.
        We plan to publish submissions (only with permission) on <a href="https://www.christoph-becker.info/research/tech-otherwise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tech Otherwise</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop, and all participants must register for the workshop.
        The workshop will be held in-person at the conference, but we will offer equally pleasurable hybrid attendance
        for participants unable to travel (e.g., for disability reasons).
